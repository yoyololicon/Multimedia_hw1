			I wandered lonely as a cloud
			<br>That floats on high o’er vales and hills,
			<br>When all at once I saw a crowd,
			<br>A host, of <strong>golden daffodils</strong>;
			<br>Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
			<br>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
			<br>
			<br>Continuous as the stars that shine
			<br>And twinkle on the milky way,
			<br>They stretched in <em>never-ending line</em>
			<br>Along the margin of a bay:
			<br>Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
			<br>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
			<br>
			<br>The waves beside them danced; but they
			<br>Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
			<br>A poet could not but be <strong>gay</strong>,
			<br>In such a jocund company:
			<br>I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
			<br>What wealth the show to me had brought:
			<br>
			<br>For oft, when on my couch I lie
			<br>In vacant or in pensive mood,
			<br>They flash upon that inward eye
			<br>Which is the bliss of solitude;
			<br>And then my heart with pleasure fills,
			<br>And dances with the <strong>daffodils</strong>.
